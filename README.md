# Who am I

Hey! My name is Piotr Iwanicki and I have a bachelor's degree in Journalism & Social Communication, I also studied Media Marketing & PR. So what am I doing here you ask? Well I always had a little bit of a technical side in me, and this all bloomed when I was working on L2 support. So right now I'm learning software testing, Java programming and many more cool IT stuff. Here I will be sharing my experience, gained knowledge and skills.
